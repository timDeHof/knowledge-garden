compound statements that alter program control flowâ€”the order of execution of program statements.

## Comparison Operators
```python
    == # equal values
    != # not equal
    >  # left operand is greater than right operand
    <  # left operand is less than right operand
    >= # left operand is greater or equal to than right operand
    <= # left operand is less than or equal to right operand
    <element> is <element> # check if two operands refer to same object in memory
```

# nonlocal
:a keyword used to reference a variable in the nearest scope.

## Advantages of nonlocal:
* It helps in accessing the variable in the upper scope.
* Since the referenced variable is reused, the memory address of the variable is also reused and therefore it saves memory.
## Disadvantages of nonlocal:
* The nonlocal keyword canâ€™t be used to reference global or local variables.
* The nonlocal keyword can only be used inside nested structures.

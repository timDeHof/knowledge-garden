## IDEEA: Specialist UX designers focus on one area of design and become experts, while generalist UX designers have a broad range of responsibilities. T-shaped designers are specialists who also have skills in other areas.

### Details:

- Specialist UX designers dive deep into one type of design and gain in-depth
  knowledge in that area.
- Specialist designers become well-known in the industry for their expertise in
  a particular type of design.
- Generalist UX designers have a broad range of responsibilities and typically
  work in entry-level positions.
- Generalist designers can expand their skills in many different types of UX
  work and find an area of UX that they're passionate about.
- T-shaped designers have deep knowledge in one area of design and related
  skills in a broad number of areas.
- T-shaped designers are beneficial for teams since they combine the benefits of
  both specialists and generalists.
- As designers progress in their career, they tend to naturally develop a
  T-shape in their abilities.
- Designers can direct their T-shape by developing specific skills that can lead
  to new experiences and professional growth.

### Title: Specialist vs. Generalist vs. T-shaped UX Designers.

## IDEEA: When deciding whether to specialize or be a generalist, it's important to consider personal goals, career trajectory, and the job market.

### Details:

- Specializing can lead to greater expertise and recognition in a particular
  area, which can be beneficial for career growth.
- However, specializing too narrowly can limit job opportunities and may not be
  sustainable in the long term if the market demand for that specialty
  decreases.
- Being a generalist can provide more job opportunities, especially in smaller
  companies with fewer UX designers.
- Generalists can also explore different areas of UX design and find what
  they're most passionate about.
- However, being a generalist may not provide the same level of recognition and
  specialization as being a specialist.
- T-shaped designers can provide the best of both worlds by having deep
  knowledge in one area while also having skills in other areas.
- It's important to consider personal goals and career trajectory when deciding
  whether to specialize or be a generalist.
- The job market should also be considered, as some areas of UX design may be in
  higher demand than others.

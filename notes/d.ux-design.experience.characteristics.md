  their abilities or disabilities.
- The design should be aesthetically pleasing, with a clear and consistent
  visual language.
- The product should be responsive and fast, with minimal load times.
- The UX should be consistent across different devices and platforms, providing
  a seamless experience for the user.

  case of any issues.
- The UX should provide meaningful feedback to the user, letting them know
  what's happening and what to expect next.

  transparent data usage and storage regulations.

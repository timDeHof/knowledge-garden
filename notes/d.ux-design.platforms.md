## IDEEA: Designing for Multiple Platforms

### Details:

- Platforms are the medium on which users experience a product, such as desktop,
  mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays, etc.
- UX designers should design with multiple platforms in mind to ensure a
  consistent user experience across all platforms.
- It's important to focus on one platform first and then design for additional
  platforms later.
- The selected platform should be the one that best meets the end-users' needs.
- Brand identity, which refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company,
  should be consistent across all platforms.
- Some functionalities only exist within certain platforms, and designers should
  consider this when planning the design.
- Voice assistants, which were initially available only on mobile phones, are
  now integrated into many other platforms, such as desktop computers, TVs, and
  refrigerators.
- Designers should plan for an almost infinite number of different devices and
  screen sizes when designing for multiple platforms.
- The current landscape provides UX designers with more opportunities than ever
  to design features for their users.

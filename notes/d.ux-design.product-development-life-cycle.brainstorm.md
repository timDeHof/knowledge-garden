## IDEEA:

The brainstorm stage is crucial in the product development life cycle, where
teams list user problems and come up with solutions to them.

### Details:

- Brainstorming is the first stage in the product development life cycle.
- The team starts by listing user problems or reviewing user feedback to
  identify problems to solve.
- Diversity in the team, across identifiers such as race, gender, abilities,
  family structure, age, and ethnicity, leads to more effective brainstorming.
- Teams may review user feedback about similar products or the results of user
  surveys to guide their ideas.
- Checking out competitors and identifying gaps in the market is important.
- A UX designer's involvement in the brainstorm stage varies depending on the
  size of the company.

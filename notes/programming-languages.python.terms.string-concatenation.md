To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

## examples
### Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:
```python
    a = "Hello"
    b = "World"
    c = a + b
    print(c)
```
### To add a space between variables, add a " ":
```python
    a = "Hello"
    b = "World"
    c = a + " " + b
    print(c)
```

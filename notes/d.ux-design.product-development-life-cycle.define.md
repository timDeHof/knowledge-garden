## IDEEA: Define stage - Narrowing the focus of the product idea and specifying product requirements.

### Details:

- The define stage is the second stage in the product development life cycle.
- The goal of this stage is to specify the product requirements by answering
  questions like who is the product for, what will it do, and what features are
  necessary for the product to be successful.
- The team, which includes UX designers, UX researchers, program managers, and
  product leads, work together to define the product.
- The focus of the product idea is narrowed down, as one product can't solve
  every user problem.
- In this stage, a product lead defines the scope of the project, while a UX
  designer helps the team to pin down the focus of the idea.
- The research completed in the brainstorm stage is used to pinpoint potential
  user problems.
- User feedback is crucial to understanding what problems users are
  experiencing.

  feedback, which they can then analyze and present to the team.
- The feedback obtained should be carefully evaluated and considered during the
  product definition process to ensure that the product meets the users' needs
  and expectations.

  idea to solve a specific user problem effectively.

## IDEEA: The user should be at the center of every UX decision.

### Details:

- The user is a person trying to solve a problem with a product or service.
- UX design focuses on designing the journey the user takes with that product or
- service.
- Initial UX research focuses on understanding user characteristics,goals, and
  pain points to create helpful and easy-to-use experiences.
- Avoid taking a narrow view of the user or making assumptions based on
  stereotypes.
- Plan to address the needs of overlooked users, such as those with disabilities
- or impairments.
- Consider questions such as user familiarity with technology, how they access
  the product, and when and where they use it.
- Include a wide selection of potential users in research, such as income level,
  demographic
- data, educational background, and geographic location.

### Title: UX design puts the user first, requires wide user research

## IDEEA: Conducting user research is essential for effective UX design.

### Details:

- User research is a critical step in creating effective UX designs.
- It helps to understand user needs, behavior, and expectations.
- User research methods include surveys, interviews, usability testing, and user
  observation.
- Surveys can provide quantitative data on user preferences and demographics.
- Interviews can give qualitative data on user goals, pain points, and
  motivations.
- Usability testing can identify usability issues in a design.
- User observation can reveal how users interact with a product in their natural
  setting.
- User research must be conducted early and continuously throughout the design
  process.
- Findings from user research should inform design decisions.
- Incorporating user feedback into the design process leads to a better user
  experience.

### Title: Effective UX design requires continuous user research.

## IDEEA: Usability testing is crucial for ensuring a positive user experience.

### Details:

- Usability testing involves observing users interacting with a product to
  identify usability issues.
- It helps to improve the overall user experience and ensure that the product
  meets user needs.
- Usability testing can be conducted in person or remotely.
- In-person testing allows for direct observation and interaction with users,
  but it can be expensive and time-consuming.
- Remote testing is more convenient and cost-effective, but it can be
  challenging to get accurate and detailed feedback from users.
- Usability testing should be conducted with a diverse group of users to capture
  a range of perspectives.
- Test tasks should be realistic and representative of typical user scenarios.
- Usability test results should be analyzed and prioritized to identify the most
  critical issues.
- Iterative testing should be conducted to ensure that design changes address
  the identified issues.
- Incorporating usability testing into the design process can lead to a more
  user-friendly and successful product.

### Title: Usability testing ensures a user-friendly product.

## IDEEA: Designing for accessibility and inclusive product features

### Details:

- More than 1 billion people worldwide have disabilities.
- In the US, one in four adults identifies as having a disability.
- Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or
  environments for people with disabilities.
- Accessibility is about making products accessible to all people, whether they
  have a disability or not.
- Inclusive product features can increase magnification, like enlarged fonts, or
  help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.
- Features initially designed for users with disabilities became universally
  used by non-disabled people as well.
- Designing for accessibility is a way to get products to as many users as
  possible.
- UX designers should keep users with disabilities in mind when designing
  products or features.

### Title: Designing for Accessibility and Inclusion

## IDEEA: Considering the level of digital literacy of potential users

### Details:

- Nearly a billion people worldwide are getting online for the first time.
- Digital literacy is the ability to use information and communication
  technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring
  both cognitive and technical skills.
- People with limited digital literacy might not be familiar with certain design
  patterns, calls to action, or icons.
- Limited digital literacy can affect users' confidence and willingness to
  explore new technology.
- UX designers should consider users' level of digital literacy when designing
  products or features.

### Title: Designing for Users with Limited Digital Literacy

## IDEEA: Taking the offline experience into account

### Details:

- Not all users have reliable or unlimited access to the internet.
- Some users might not have internet access due to the cost and availability of
  devices and internet services.
- UX designers should try to find ways to take the offline experience into
  account.
- Creating a rich offline experience for users can improve their experience with
  the product or service.

### Title: Designing for the Offline Experience

## IDEEA: Considering location and cultural norms of users

### Details:

- Different locations around the world create additional considerations for UX
  designers.
- Local languages and cultural norms should be taken into account when designing
  products or features.
- Cultures and norms are ever-changing, so designers need to continue
  researching potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences,
  and usage patterns.
- Users who speak languages other than the primary language of the product might
  want or need to switch languages on their device.
- Designing a multilingual keyboard option and using universally-recognized
  icons can make it easier for users in different locales.

### Title: Designing for Global Users and Multilingualism

## IDEEA: Comprehensive understanding of user's context is important

### Details:

- The goal of UX design is to solve a user problem by creating a design that
  makes every user feel like the experience was designed just for them.
- Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the user's context is an important
  place to start.
- UX designers should consider users' disabilities, level of digital literacy,
  access to the internet, location, and cultural norms when designing products
  or features.
- Throughout the rest of the certificate program, learners will learn more about
  user research methodology and complete practice activities to gain a better
  understanding of their users.

## What is the Design Thinking framework in UX design?

- The Design Thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving
  in UX design

- The Design Thinking framework is an iterative process, which means that
  designers may need to repeat certain phases as they refine their designs based
  on feedback received during testing.

## What are the five phases of the framework?

- Empathize: This phase involves researching and understanding the user, their
- problems, and the context of their experience with the design.
- Define: In this phase, designers analyze their research and identify the user
  problems that are
- most important to solve, which will drive the clear goals for the design of
  the
- product.
- Ideate: In this phase, designers brainstorm multiple solutions to the problem,
  explore all possible options, and make choices about which ones are the
- best options to pursue as prototypes.
- Prototype and Test: This phase involves producing an early model of a product
  that demonstrates its functionality and can be tested. Designers iterate and
  refine the prototype based on user feedback until they reach the final
  product.

## what three ways to put user first in your designs?

### Universal design

#### IDEEA: Universal Design's One-Size-Fits-All Approach is Ineffective

##### Details:

- Universal design aims to create a single solution for users with various
  abilities and situations.
- However, the one-size-fits-all approach often results in designs that are not
  effective for anyone.
- The example of a hat labeled "one-size-fits-all" demonstrates this problem.
- Universal design had good intentions but excluded many people in practice.
- UX designers realized the limitations of universal design and sought to change
  their approach to be more inclusive.

### Inclusive design

#### IDEEA: Inclusive Design Prioritizes Diversity and Individual Needs

##### Details:

- Inclusive design is an approach that focuses on meeting the diverse needs of
  individuals, rather than creating a single solution for everyone.
- It prioritizes diversity and aims to create designs that are usable by the
  greatest number of people.
- Inclusive design considers factors such as age, gender, race, culture, and
  abilities.
- Inclusive design can be describe with one phrase of "Solve for one, extend to
  many".
- It involves involving users in the design process, listening to their
  feedback, and making changes accordingly.
- The goal of inclusive design is to create products that are accessible,
  functional, and enjoyable for all users.

##### Title suggestion: Prioritizing Diversity and Individual Needs in Inclusive Design

#### IDEEA: Inclusive Design Principles Guide the Design Process

##### Details:

- Inclusive design principles provide guidelines for creating products that meet
  the diverse needs of individuals.
- The seven principles of inclusive design include: equitable use, flexibility
  in use, simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, tolerance for
  error, low physical effort, and size and space for approach and use.
- These principles help designers to consider the needs of different users,
  including those with disabilities or other challenges.
- Equitable use means that a design is accessible and can be used by everyone.
- Flexibility in use allows users to interact with a design in multiple ways.
- Simple and intuitive use means that a design is easy to understand and use.
- Perceptible information means that a design communicates important information
  clearly and effectively.
- Tolerance for error means that a design minimizes the likelihood of errors and
  provides feedback to help users correct mistakes.
- Low physical effort means that a design requires minimal physical effort to
  use.
- Size and space for approach and use means that a design accommodates different
  body sizes and types of interaction.

#### IDEEA: Inclusive Design Benefits Everyone, Not Just Marginalized Groups

##### Details:

- Inclusive design benefits everyone, not just individuals with disabilities or
  other marginalized groups.
- When designers create products that are accessible and easy to use, it
  benefits everyone, including individuals who are not part of the targeted user
  group.
- For example, curb cuts were originally designed for individuals using
  wheelchairs but are now used by many other people, including parents with
  strollers, delivery workers with carts, and individuals with mobility
  challenges.
- Inclusive design can also lead to innovation and creativity, as designers are
  forced to think outside the box to meet the diverse needs of users.
- By creating products that work for everyone, companies can reach a wider
  audience and improve customer satisfaction.

#### IDEEA: Inclusive Design Improves User Experience and Business Outcomes

##### Details:

- Inclusive design leads to better user experiences by addressing the diverse
  needs of individuals.
- When products are designed with inclusivity in mind, they are more accessible,
  easier to use, and more enjoyable for everyone.
- Inclusive design also has business benefits, such as expanding the potential
  customer base and improving customer satisfaction.
- By creating products that are accessible to a wider range of users, businesses
  can increase their reach and revenue.
- Inclusive design can also help to mitigate legal and financial risks
  associated
- with inaccessible products. Inclusive design is becoming increasingly
  important
- as more businesses recognize the value of creating products that are
  accessible
- to everyone.

### equity-focused design

#### IDEEA: Equity-focused design aims to uplift historically underrepresented groups by providing different levels of opportunity and support to achieve fair outcomes.

##### Details:

- Equity-focused design is a newer concept in UX design.
- The goal is to design products that meet the needs of specific individuals in
  groups who have been excluded in the past.
- It goes beyond inclusive design, which aims to build products for groups that
  have been historically excluded.
- Equity means providing different levels of opportunity and support for each
  person to achieve fair outcomes.
- Equality means providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all
  segments of society.
- Designers must understand the difference between equity and equality to design
  with equity as a goal.
- Equity-focused design doesn't solve all problems, but it's an approach to
  designing for a more equitable future.
- To implement equity-focused design, identify a product, think about the groups
  that have not been served in the past, and design while keeping them
- front and center.
- Accessibility, inclusive design, and equity-focused design should be
  considered during the design process as a requirement, not just an
- option.

##### Title: Equity-focused design: Building for a more equitable future.

#### IDEEA: Understanding the importance of designing for underrepresented and excluded groups in order to create a more equitable future.

##### Details:

- Inclusive design aims to build products for groups that have been historically
  excluded, while equity-focused design seeks to build products that meet the
  needs of specific individuals in underrepresented groups.
- Designers should consider accessibility, inclusive design, and equity-focused
  design as a requirement, not an option, when creating products.
- Providing equal opportunity and support to all segments of society is not
  enough to create an equitable future.
- Equity-focused design requires providing different levels of opportunity and
  support to achieve fair outcomes for all individuals.
- The goal of equity-focused design is to uplift groups that have been
  historically excluded and provide them with the tools they need to thrive.
- By designing for underrepresented and excluded groups, designers can create
  products that are more useful, accessible, and equitable for all individuals.
- It's crucial for designers to understand the importance of designing for
  underrepresented and excluded groups to create a more equitable future.

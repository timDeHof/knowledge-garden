**what is Polymorphism**
:The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.The difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.
```python
# Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-
# morphic functions
 
# len() being used for a string
print(len("geeks"))
 
# len() being used for a list
print(len([10, 20, 30]))
```

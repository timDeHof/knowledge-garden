: anonymous functions in python
## syntax 
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
* This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
* One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.
* You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
* It has various uses in particular fields of programming, besides other types of expressions in functions.

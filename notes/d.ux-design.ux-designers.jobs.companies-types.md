- Startups: tight budgets, few employees, generalist role, responsible for
  interaction and visual design, user research, and even marketing

  make own schedule, work with different brands

  responsible for developing wireframes and designs for digital products, may
  also do graphic design or writing, part of a team
- Design agencies/studios: specialized in design and branding, one-stop-shop for
  the look of brands, products, and services, usually more specialized than ad
  agencies, exposed to different industries, work on different stages of a
  product's development

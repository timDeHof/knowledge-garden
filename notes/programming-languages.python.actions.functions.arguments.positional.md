## Positional Arguments
:needed to be included in proper order i.e the first argument is always listed first when the function is called, second argument needs to be called second and so on.
```python
    def person_name(first_name,second_name):
    print(first_name+second_name)
    
    # First name is Ram placed first
    # Second name is Babu place second
    person_name("Ram","Babu") # output -> RamBabu
```

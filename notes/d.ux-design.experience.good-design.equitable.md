## IDEEA: Equitable product design considers diverse user needs and provides tools for improved quality of life.

### Details:

- Equity is about designing products to meet the needs of diverse audiences.
- Equality means giving everyone the same resources, but equity recognizes that
  people have different needs.
- Products should be designed to support traditionally underrepresented and
  excluded groups.
- Evaluating a product's equity requires asking if the needs of diverse users
  are considered.
- The design of a product should provide tools that help users accomplish their
  goals.
- An example of a more equitable design is a social messaging app that includes
  different skin tones and gender-neutral avatar options.

### Title: Equitable Design Prioritizes User Diversity & Support.

## IDEEA: Accessibility should be a key consideration in product design to ensure that all users can access and benefit from the product.

### Details:

- Accessibility is a crucial component of product design that ensures users with
  disabilities can access and use the product.
- Accessibility design includes considerations such as screen readers, color
  contrast, and keyboard navigation.
- Product designers should prioritize accessibility to ensure that all users can
  benefit from their product.
- Failing to prioritize accessibility can lead to excluding large segments of
  the population, limiting the product's impact and reach.
- An example of prioritizing accessibility in a product would be designing a
  website with clear headings and alt text descriptions for images to aid those
  using screen readers.

### Title: Accessible Design Ensures All Users Benefit from Products.

## IDEEA: Inclusive design involves intentionally designing products to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.

### Details:

- Inclusive design is an approach that focuses on designing products that can be
  used by a broad range of users, including those with disabilities.
- Inclusive design involves considering a wide range of needs and preferences
  during the design process.
- It can help reduce barriers to access for traditionally underrepresented and
  excluded groups.
- Inclusive design considers factors such as user context, user goals, and user
  capabilities to create products that meet diverse needs.
- By designing products that accommodate a range of needs and preferences,
  inclusive design can enhance the user experience for all users.
- An example of inclusive design is creating a website that can be navigated
  using both a mouse and keyboard, making it accessible to users with motor
  impairments.

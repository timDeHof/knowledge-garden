## IDEEA: Good UX Design considers the user's needs and creates products that are intuitive, easy to use, and tied to specific emotions.

### Details:

- Good UX Design focuses on creating products that are usable, equitable,
  enjoyable, and useful.
- This involves considering the user's needs and designing products that are
  intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on tying a specific emotion to the
  experience of using the product.
- For example, shopping apps should allow users to easily purchase items and not
  create roadblocks, like adding items to a cart only to find out they are out
  of stock.
- It's important to pay attention to everyday experiences, recognizing positive
  and negative design aspects to think about how to improve products.

## IDEEA: Norman Doors are doors with poor user experience, which don't consider the user's needs.

### Details:

- Norman Doors are doors that have poor user experience because they are
  difficult to use and don't consider the user's needs.
- Don Norman, who invented the term "UX," first described this phenomenon in his
  book "The Design of Everyday Things"
- Norman Doors are a good example of how a user's experience isn't always
  considered in a product's design.
- Designers must think about how to improve the user experience of doors, so
  users can easily enter and exit through them.

##IDEEA: Good UX design considers the user's needs and emotions, making products
intuitive and easy to use.

### Details:

- Good UX design aims to create products that are usable, equitable, enjoyable,
  and useful.
- Designers must consider the user's needs and emotions when creating a product,
  tying a specific emotion to the experience of using the product.
- For example, a shopping app should be designed to make the user feel excited
  about buying things.
- However, if a user adds a product to their cart and is then told it's out of
  stock, it creates a poor user experience.
- Good design should be intuitive and easy to use, and it should consider the
  user's needs and emotions to create a positive user experience.

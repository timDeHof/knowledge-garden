## IDEEA: Creating information architecture is an important responsibility of UX designers.

### Details:

- Information architecture is the framework of a website that determines its
  organization, categorization, and structure.

  navigation.
- Information architecture is created by determining the hierarchy of
  information and grouping similar items together.
- The information architecture should be consistent across the entire product.

## Overview

- React Router enables "client side routing"
- Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click
  without making another request for another document from the server.
- This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to
  request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for
  the next page.
- It also enables more dynamic user experiences with things like animation.

## IDEEA: The product development lifecycle consists of five stages that take a product from an idea to launch.

### Details:

- The five stages are brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch.
- The brainstorm stage is about generating ideas and understanding the audience
  and their needs or challenges.
- The define stage narrows the focus and determines the impact the product will
  have on the user.
- The design stage is where UX designers actively develop ideas and create
  sketches, wireframes, or prototypes.
- The test stage evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential
  users to refine or improve the design.
- The launch stage involves sharing a finished version of the product with the
  public, but the work on the product is not finished as feedback may require
  improvements.

## IDEEA: UX Designers work with engineers to create functional prototypes.

### Details:

- UX designers collaborate with engineers to develop functional prototypes that
  match the original designs.
- Prototypes include details and features that fit the company's brand, such as
  font and color choices.
- Writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product is also
  part of the process.
- Another option is to test a functioning prototype of the product using design
  tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

### Title: Collaborating with Engineers to Create Functional Prototypes.

## IDEEA: Designs undergo at least three phases of testing.

### Details:

- Designs undergo three phases of testing: internal tests, stakeholder reviews,
  and external tests.
- Alpha testing refers to internal tests conducted to identify technical
  glitches and usability problems.
- Stakeholder review ensures the product aligns with the company's vision, meets
  legal guidelines, and follows regulations.
- Beta testing involves external testing with potential users to determine if
  the product provides a good user experience.
- UX researchers are typically responsible for conducting these tests.

### Title: Three Phases of Design Testing.

## IDEEA: Gathering feedback and implementing changes is critical during the testing phase.

### Details:

- Gathering and implementing feedback is critical during testing to ensure the
  product provides a good user experience.
- UX designers make adjustments or create new versions of the design if users
  are frustrated or confused.
- Testing is repeated until there is little or no friction between the product
  and the user.
- The product development lifecycle is not always linear, and the team may cycle
  between designing and testing before launch.

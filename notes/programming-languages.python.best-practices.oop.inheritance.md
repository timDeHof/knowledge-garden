: the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

## Benefits of inheritance:
- It represents real-world relationships well.
- It provides the reusability of a code. 
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another classA, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

## Python Inheritance Syntax
Class BaseClass:
    {Body}
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    {Body}

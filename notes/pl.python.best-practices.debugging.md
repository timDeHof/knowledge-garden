# linting
:  a process for identifying bugs and stylistic errors in your code. The process is carried out by analysis tools called ‘linters’, which are widely available for every major programming language. Linters will flag issues and style violations in your code, sort of like a spell checker!

# pdb 
: an interactive source code debugger for Python programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program control.
